  <!-- 
    NV Monogram Logo
    - viewBox: Defines the coordinate system for the SVG.
    - path: The single path that draws both letters.
    - stroke: The color of the lines. Using "currentColor" would make it inherit the text color, 
      but for a logo, a fixed color like this light gray (#E5E7EB) is often better.
    - stroke-width: The thickness of the lines.
    - stroke-linecap/linejoin: "round" gives the line endings and corners a softer, more modern look.
    - fill="none": Ensures the shape is not filled with color, only the stroke is visible.
